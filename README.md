Hello there! 

Welcome to our sneaker reccomendation tool. For our project we focused on the use of classes and webscraping in order to garner
information about womens and mens shoes. To then take a mast amount of data about those shoes and wittle it down based upon 
conditions the user inputs to give them reccomendations along with a link where they can access the shoe itself. 

In order to work out project you must start with opening the mens sneaker scraper python file and the women sneaker scraper 
python file. Those files will create a csv that contained all of the data webscrapped from the nike website. We have attched 
the CSV files in the repository as shoe_dict_exported for men and women_shoe_dict_exported for the women shoes. 
The user_prompt file is the one that creates the user input and prints out a string containing a table of the reccomended shoes.

For testing of different scenarios we have pre built a file that has a set of different trails to run through in the test_code 
file. 

Enjoy our script and hopefully you can learn something!
